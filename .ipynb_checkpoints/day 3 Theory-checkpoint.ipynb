    "1. Classification DT: This will determine a set of logical if-then conditions to classify the problem\n",
    "   eg: type flower\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regression DT:It is used when we have numeric/continous data\n",
    "    eg: measure height  of the son and father\n",

    "### Entropy: It is the measure of randomness in dataset(It measure purity in data split)\n",

    "### Information Gain: It is the measure of decrease in entropy after the dataset is split.\n",

    "    Boosting is the process that uses a set of machine learning algorithm (Decision Tree) to combine weak learners to form strong learners in order to increase the accuracy of model.\n",
